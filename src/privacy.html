<h1>Micheli.dev Privacy Policy</h1>
<hr />

<p>
  This is a simple privacy policy in plain language for Micheli.dev, which provides some test apps,
  nothing fancy so far. It may be updated from time to time as additional software goes into
  production and necessitates more refined policy. You can check this page for any changes.
</p>

<p>
  Right now, no services really collect any personal information. Some apps may accept API requests
  including, e.g., a first name and that might be stored in a database long-term, but it is just as
  likely to be purged during a reset. Additionally, some logs might include your public IP address,
  which can be loosely associated with your identity.
