<h1>Graphics Programming</h1>
<p>
  Graphics programming is a broad concept covering a variety of applications distinguished by their
  focus on providing visually interesting or highly realistic outputs. Such applications are most
  often written in low-level languages like C, C++, and Rust and rely on low-level graphics APIs to
  interact with the underlying hardware.

  <h2>MD Renderer</h2>

  Render." %}

  <p>
    MD Renderer is a realtime rendering engine written in Rust and interacting with the GPU through
    the Vulkan API, the modern successor to OpenGL. Vulkan exposes an extremely low-level interface
    by which applications can interact with the memory, execution, and threading model of the GPU in
    order to write highly efficient graphics applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Presently, the engine uses a Blinn-Phong shading to provide reasonable visual fidelity using
    classic PBR-style materials with surface properties defined using color, roughness, and normal
    maps. It supports multiple lights and allows a user to implement simple interactions with the
    scene through keyboard/mouse inputs, which the example uses to provide an FPS-style camera to
    explore the test scene.

<h1>Frontend</h1>
<p>
  Frontend projects demonstrate a developer's ability to write code executed or displayed on a
  client's machine, often in a browser. Modern frontend development depends on knowledge of HTML,
  CSS, and JavaScript, as well as comfort using varied frameworks and among changing standards.

  <h2>WebGL Game of Life</h2>

  grid. Black cells are dead, while white cells are alive." %}

  <p>
    Conway's Game of Life is a classic project for frontend developers because it is both visually
    impressive and mathematically beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to demonstrating standard frontend principles, my rendition of the Game of Life
    makes use of the Lit framework to output a reusable native web component. Further, the game is
    "played" using GLSL fragment shaders compiled and executed on the host's GPU, demonstrating
    basic graphics pipelining and framebuffer swapping in addition to providing a much more
    performant, parallelized version of the game.

<h1>Automation and Tooling</h1>
<p>
  Scripting and automation can be a full-time job in and of themselves, but an ability to automate
  easy or repetitive tasks is invaluable in any environment. In my own workflow, I use command line
  tools developed in Python, build automation in Docker, Github Actions, and even platform-specific
  libraries like Windows Presentation Foundation to make tools accessible to non-technical people.

  <h2>Patent Downloader</h2>

  starting a download." %}

  <p>
    The Patent Downloader (PDL) tool was developed to help paralegals at a law firm onboard new
    clients with large IP portfolios. Previously, paralegals would search for, download, and rename
    PDFs of patents by handâ€”a process which could take an entire workday. This tool completes the
    same task in seconds.
  </p>

  <p>
    The PDL is a WPF application written in C#, using Microsoft's .NET framework. When users input a
    file containing a list of patent numbers, the tool scrapes the file to generate a list of
    patents to download before beginning a download processes using worker threads to download
    multiple documents at a time. In addition to outputting PDFs, the PDL provides robust logging
    options to report results for record-keeping or bug reporting.
