<h1>Frontend</h1>
<p>
  Frontend projects demonstrate a developer's ability to write code executed or displayed on a
  client's machine, often in a browser. Modern frontend development depends on knowledge of HTML,
  CSS, and JavaScript, as well as comfort using varied frameworks and among changing standards.

  <h2>WebGL Game of Life</h2>

  <p>
    Conway's Game of Life is a classic project for frontend developers because it is both visually
    impressive and mathematically beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to demonstrating standard frontend principles, my rendition of the Game of Life
    makes use of the Lit framework to output a reusable native web component. Further, the game is
    "played" using GLSL fragment shaders compiled and executed on the host's CPU, demonstrating
    basic graphics pipelining and framebuffer swapping in addition to providing a much more
    performant, parallelized version of the game.
